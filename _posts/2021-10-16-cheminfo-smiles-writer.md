The algorithm of building a SMILES string for a molecular structure was mentioned by D. Weininger et al [1], "the structure is treated as a tree and a SMILES string is generated that corresponds to a depth-first search (DFS) of that tree ... and a second
DFS search is performed for polycyclic structures to to ensure proper ordering of ring closure labels." However the details of implementations cannot be found in this paper. 

A. Varnek [2] explains in details this algorithm and the Python code is provided.

Following the instruction from [2], I have implemented this algorithm in Rust available from [here](https://github.com/chiral-data/rust-chem/blob/main/src/smiles_writer.rs) and a demonstration by example can be found [here](https://vj8hk.csb.app/smiles).

Two new findings are worth to be mentioned:
1. The python code from [2] writes bond symbols for ring closures twices, which is incorrect.  
2. The order of closure digits by the same closing atom is not defined in SMILES specification [3]. For example, _Oc1cccc2ccccc12_ and _Oc1cccc2ccccc21_ are both valid SMILES. However, for canonical SMILES, this order has to be definitive.
